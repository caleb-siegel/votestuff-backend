    Update product rankings within a list based on voting data.
    
    This is the core ranking algorithm that determines the order products appear
    in a list. Products are sorted using a three-tier priority system:
    
    RANKING PRIORITY (in order of importance):
    ------------------------------------------
    1. NET SCORE (Primary): upvotes - downvotes
       - Products with higher net scores rank higher
       - Example: Product A (10 up, 2 down = net +8) ranks above Product B (5 up, 0 down = net +5)
    
    2. UPVOTE PERCENTAGE (Secondary - used when net scores are equal):
       - Percentage of total votes that are upvotes
       - Products with higher upvote % rank higher (shows more consistent positive sentiment)
       - Example: Product A (8 up, 2 down = 80% upvote) ranks above Product B (40 up, 10 down = 80% upvote)
                  if they have the same net score
    
    3. MOST RECENT UPVOTE TIMESTAMP (Tertiary - breaks ties):
       - When both net score and upvote % are equal, the product with the most recent upvote wins
       - This promotes fresh/recently validated products
       - Products with no upvotes use datetime.min (oldest possible date) so they rank last
    
    ALGORITHM STEPS:
    ----------------
    1. Fetch all products in the list
    2. For each product, find the most recent upvote timestamp (if any)
    3. Sort products using the three-tier priority system
    4. Assign ranks (1 = highest rank, 2 = second, etc.)
    5. Update the list's total_votes counter (sum of all product votes)
    
    Called after every vote operation to keep rankings current and accurate.
